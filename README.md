# Online-Risks-Faced-By-Children

## Mission
Our mission is to safeguard children from online risksâ€”not by limiting their access to digital knowledge, but by transforming their online space into a secure, enriching environment where they can learn and thrive.

## Overview
This project is a collaborative initiative by Design Dynamos at Mahindra University, Bahadurpally, Hyderabad. We applied a structured design thinking process to address the complex issue of online risks faced by children, such as privacy breaches, exposure to harmful content, and cyberbullying. Our goal is to empower children with the tools and knowledge necessary to navigate the digital world safely.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Planning
- **Problem Statement Generation:**  
  - Each team member developed 14 unique problem statements, resulting in a total of 84 diverse statements.
  - These statements spanned various scopes, including urban challenges, personal issues, global concerns, rural life, disability, and childhood/parenting.
- **Evaluation:**  
  - Using an Excel sheet, we evaluated each problem statement based on clarity, specificity, user-centricity, measurability, relevance, feasibility, impact, and being solution-agnostic.
- **Mentorship:**  
  - Through discussions with our mentor, Raj Narayanan sir, we refined our statements and identified the most pressing issues.

### Phase 2: Research
- **Data Collection:**  
  - We designed online surveys incorporating hypothetical scenarios to gather insights on how children and their guardians experience online risks.
  - These surveys helped us capture real-world perspectives and refine our understanding of the challenges.
- **Problem Statement Refinement:**  
  - After thorough analysis and team discussions, we settled on the refined problem statement:  
    *"Children are exposed to online risks like their privacy being compromised or getting exposed to harmful content. This not only affects their safety but also their emotional well-being. To tackle this issue, we need an approach to promote a secure and enriching digital environment for children so that they can grow with the digital world without sacrificing their personal information and mental health."*

### Phase 3: Prototyping
- **Visual Communication:**  
  - We created an A3-sized poster (3508px x 4961px) that uses a blend of images, graphs, and text to communicate our research and insights to a general audience within five minutes.
- **Iterative Feedback:**  
  - The design and content were refined through continuous feedback from our team and mentor.
- **Brainstorming:**  
  - Using the 6-3-5 rule, each team member contributed ideas in structured rounds, resulting in a pool of 1,260 potential solutions.

## Methodologies

### Root Cause Analysis
- We performed a detailed analysis by continuously asking "Why?" to identify the fundamental causes behind the online risks faced by children. This iterative questioning helped us uncover the core issues that needed addressing.

### 6-3-5 Brainstorming
- **Process:**  
  - In groups, each participant wrote down 3 ideas within 5 minutes.
  - The ideas were passed around and built upon over 5 rounds, generating a total of 15 ideas per person.
- **Outcome:**  
  - This method facilitated the generation of 1,260 innovative solutions, which were later evaluated for their practicality.

### DFV Analysis (Desirability, Feasibility, Viability)
- **Desirability:**  
  - Assesses whether there is a genuine need or market demand for the solution.
- **Feasibility:**  
  - Examines the technical and practical aspects of implementing the solution.
- **Viability:**  
  - Evaluates the potential for long-term sustainability and profitability.
- **Application:**  
  - DFV analysis was key in narrowing down our extensive list of ideas to those most likely to succeed in a real-world setting.

## Business Models
- **Online Safety and Privacy Education:**  
  - Initiatives aimed at enhancing digital literacy and privacy awareness among children.
- **Parental Controls and Monitoring Software:**  
  - Tools designed to empower parents with better means of monitoring and protecting their children online.
- **Digital Literacy and Critical Thinking Programs:**  
  - Educational programs to equip children with the skills needed to navigate the digital landscape safely.
- **Lean Canvas:**  
  - We used the Lean Canvas framework to map out the problem, identify our target audience, and outline our value proposition, channels, revenue streams, cost structure, and key metrics for success.

## Outcomes and Impact
- **Comprehensive Research:**  
  - Our project is underpinned by a detailed design thinking process, from problem identification to solution prototyping.
- **Innovative Solutions:**  
  - We generated over 1,260 ideas, from which practical and impactful solutions were identified.
- **Enhanced Awareness:**  
  - The A3 poster and associated research materials effectively communicate the challenges and potential solutions, raising awareness about online safety.
- **Team Collaboration:**  
  - The project highlights the power of collaborative brainstorming and iterative refinement in addressing complex challenges.

## Future Directions
- **Development of Digital Tools:**  
  - Creating interactive digital modules for enhanced online safety and digital literacy.
- **Implementation of Parental Control Software:**  
  - Refining and testing software solutions that enable parents to better monitor online activity.
- **Community Engagement:**  
  - Organizing workshops and awareness campaigns to share our findings and educate wider communities.
- **Continuous Improvement:**  
  - Staying updated with emerging online risks and evolving our solutions accordingly.
